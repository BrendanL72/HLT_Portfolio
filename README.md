## Assignment 7: ACL Research Paper Summary
Summary of the paper: "Better Language Model with Hypernym Class Prediction", an entry into the 60th Annual Association for Computational Linguistics meeting. The paper focuses on changing the latest and greatest transformer model by using hypernym classes from the WordNet library. It shows promise with identifying rarer words more accurately that the transformer model would struggle with.
