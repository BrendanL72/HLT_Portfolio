# Assignment 1: Text Processing
This program takes a csv file of employee data and saves it in a Python dictionary file. It then reads the saved Python dictionary file and prints the information out to ensure that the data was saved correctly.

## How to Run
Use the command `python3 Homework1_bjl190000.py ./data/data.csv`

## Strength and Weaknesses of Python Text Processing
I think Python is really good for text processing because the variety of string functions available and string splicing built in. The issues I have with Python is strings are immutable, making it hard to modify strings without splicing, and that chars don't exist.

## What I Learned
I learned how to use pickle. I had been exposed to it previously when training machien learning models, but never formally learned how to until now. Everything else was a review into the intracies of Python classes and regex, like how Python member functions need to pass 'self' in as an argument or else Python doesn't know what you're talking about.
